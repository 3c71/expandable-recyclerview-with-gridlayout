Getting started
---

This project provides an Expandable RecyclerView  with  group items that can be individually expanded to show its children in a two-dimensional scrolling grid.


Usage
---
[Expandable Grid Item]
Each GridRowHolder object receives an data array to display in a row item. It is responsible for breaking up the layout of its row in rectangular cells of equal size. Each cell displays a piece of data and can be selected by user.

Please check the implementation of the simple example.
